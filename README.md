# LeetCode Practice Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to LeetCode problems, organized by topic. As a Computer Science senior passionate about full-stack development and machine learning, I use this space to deepen my understanding of data structures, algorithms, and coding patterns through consistent practice.

## Topics Covered

- [Linked Lists](./linked_lists)
- [Sliding Window](./sliding_window)
- [Binary Search](./binary_search)
- [Two Pointers](./two_pointers)
- [Dynamic Programming](./dynamic_programming)
- [Graphs](./graphs)
- [Trees](./trees)
- [Stacks & Queues](./stacks_queues)
- [Recursion & Backtracking](./recursion)
